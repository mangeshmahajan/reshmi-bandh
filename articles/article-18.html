            I have known you my whole life. You and Aaji were my two pillars that supported the foundation of my values
            and beliefs. Because of you, I am who I am today, and I abide by what I believe is right, according to what
            you have taught me. <span></span>

            I look forward to your visits so much. Every time I didn’t understand a math problem, or a science question,
            you were always there to help me out. At times, I didn’t understand the problem at hand, and all the time,
            you were there to patiently sit and explain it to me. <span></span>

            During my formative years, you always used to tell me to inculcate a practice of writing tables from 1 to
            20, and I always used to crib when you told me to do so. Today, I’m glad you did, because if you didn’t, I
            would have been a step behind all my classmates. <span></span>

            You used to make me sit when you and Aaji were doing your daily puja, and again, at first, I didn’t really
            enjoy it. Today, I’m proud that I know these bhajans and shlokas by heart. Going back to when I was just a
            little one learning to walk (I obviously do not remember), you played a significant role in teaching me how
            to walk with a chair. <span></span>

            I love and cherish the memories we have made together and look forward to making many more. Stay healthy,
            happy, and safe, always and forever. <span></span>

            Love, <br>
            Yashashree
