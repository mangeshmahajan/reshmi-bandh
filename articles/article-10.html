            What can I say about Aabamama, my words would not do the justice to describe him. But I would try my best 😊
            If I am in doubt and stressing out, all I have to do is think about him that how he would react and the
            answer is simple, he does not react, he responds to the situation beautifully. A complete giver and not
            thinking about who gets the credit. He exemplifies patience and selflessness. We admire and respect you
            Aabamama 🙏🙏 <span></span>

            Thank you for being who you are! We love you lots 😊 <span></span>

            Happy Birthday and stay healthy for all of us for next 200 years!!😁 <span></span>
