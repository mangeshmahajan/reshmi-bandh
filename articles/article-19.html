            Simple, calm, smiling, happy, content ‚Ä¶. These are the words for him. <span></span>

            He and Aai came to Ahmedabad when Yashu came into our lives. It was so nice of them that they accepted our
            request to be with us as we didn‚Äôt know how to raise a child‚Ä¶. We were so afraid and uncertain that how will
            we go through this journey alone‚Ä¶.They came and made it look so easy to us. Yashu got best childhood and
            best of everything while they were around and that was the most important time when you can mould a child
            and inculcate good virtures‚Ä¶Yashu can speak so many shlokas, chants etc because of them‚Ä¶ Aai and Papa are
            almost a unit which is inseparable and I love this most amazing thing. <span></span>

            Routine is what Papa loves. He loves to wake up early and starts his dincharya which never changes when he
            is home (Bangalore or Nashik). The best part is he never cribs about missing his dincharya when he is at
            somewhere else (relative‚Äôs place). He gets adjusted to each situation very easily and does not hold on to
            anything. <span></span>

            He never criticizes if I make horrible sabzi or any other thing‚Ä¶. I must have made it in past when I barely
            knew how to cook. Never ever I recall him telling me anything. How can someone be so adaptive‚Ä¶? I wonder
            sometimes‚Ä¶ <span></span>

            My friends used to tell me that your father-in-law should work in serials, movie. He is very good looking
            Dadaji. But how can I tell them that he can not work on sets of serials and movie as they don‚Äôt serve patal
            sabji and moong dal chawal every day. üòä This is what he eats everyday‚Ä¶he doesn‚Äôt require change, its Aai
            who gets bored and makes other ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù things around this core. Evening he loves his khichadi but he
            eats Pani Puri also on sides‚Ä¶ he like chatpata things also but never admits (as it doesn‚Äôt suit him). I
            remember we used to take Yashu to a park where one thela person used to make very chatpata Maggie. We ate
            every time from him during our visits. <span></span>

            ‚ÄòSweets‚Äô is his weakness and that has rubbed off on his children and grandchildren‚Ä¶. Til gud ghya god bola
            is not only on Dasehara‚Ä¶ he follows it throughout the year. <span></span>

            As per him everything should have logic and scientific angle‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt agree sometimes on the face but when I
            rethink what he said, 99 times out of 100 he is always right. <span></span>

            Appearance never matters to him. But I love to make him wear bright colors as he looks radiant in them and I
            am so glad he never resisted. <span></span>

            Never over ambitious, but he has done everything for his children and gave them very good sanskar and life.
            I am so blessed that Rahul is what he is because of them. <span></span>

            We love you papa to the moon and back. I wish you abundance of health and happiness on your 75th Birthday.
