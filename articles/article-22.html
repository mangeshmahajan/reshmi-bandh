            Whenever I think about Aba Kaka, a very calm & quiet personality comes into my mind along with one town name
            'Sakharwadi' which we all like to talk about. At the same time Aba kaka always keeps smiling irrespective of
            any situation that makes him unique.<span></span>

            I do not remember any instance where I found him shouting or scolding anyone and we all admire that
            quality…<span></span>

            On his 75th Birthday, We all wish Aba Kaka a very Happy & Healthy life ahead!
